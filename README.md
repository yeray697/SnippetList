# Snippet List

## Description

This is a personal project to learn React, [Material UI 4](https://v4.mui.com) and cool animations with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

## To Do

- Implement the add/edit functionality
- Clear all unused stuff
- Probably copy the existing componenets and build the app from scratch, as it is a mess because of implementing unplanned stuff.
